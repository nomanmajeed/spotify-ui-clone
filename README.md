<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="images//spotify%20clone.PNG" alt="image">

Spotify is a audio streaming and media services platform known worldwide and it's desktop app has a beautiful UI. I thought why not design a same UI clone for web. I gave it a try and here it is.

App Story:
* The UI is built for learning purpose and for boosting my web development skills specially in CSS.
* I enjoyed it's development smile:

Of course, no one perfect and I feel myself still in learning phase of software development. There might be any zig zag flow of data and any bugs in this app. Feel free to create issues if you find any bug or have some suggestion

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
